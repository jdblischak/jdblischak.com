This repo contains the source code for my personal homepage at
[jdblischak.com](https://jdblischak.com).

The HTML uses [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/). I learned using
this [tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap) from
[w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). If you find some code you like, feel
free to copy-paste and modify for your needs. It's all boilerplate Bootstrap
that's all over the internet, so there is no need to attribute me or anything
like that. However, I retain the copyright to all my personal content on the
site (e.g. headshot, CV). The [limma course logo][dc-limma-logo] is copyright of
DataCamp.
